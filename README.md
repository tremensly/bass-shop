# SSUI-Homework-3
A template for Software Structures for User Interfaces Fall 2017 course, Homework 3.

To get started with your homework, please fork this repository. Instructions can be found here:https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/

Be sure to add me, your TA, as a collaborator on your forked repository, so that I can grade your work! My github name is mkery. To add collaborators, follow this guide:https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/

Finally, when you're done, publish your webpage! This is super easy. Just go to Settings in your repository, then go to Github Pages, and set the Github Pages to follow the master branch. What does that mean? Github will look for an index.html file in your repository. Yay! There's already one there per the HW 3 template. So, Github will host the webpage it finds! Finally, please paste the URL it gives you into the description for your repository so that I can view your website!

Here's a guide to Github Pages, in case you get stuck: https://guides.github.com/features/pages/

Happy coding & designing!
